# ROADMAP

## Now
- Add configurable finding suppressions/waivers for known-acceptable exceptions.
- Add optional PDF export for HTML reports.

## Next
- Add duplicate-directive warning findings (while preserving browser-first parsing behavior).
- Add pipeline integration snippets for common CI systems beyond GitHub Actions.

## Later
- Policy baselines with environment-specific metadata (staging/prod tracking).
- Optional import path for CSP violation report samples to aid rollout tuning.
